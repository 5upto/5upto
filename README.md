# Shawon Ghosh's GitHub Profile

Welcome to my GitHub! 👋

I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at **NIT Rourkela**, pursuing my B.Tech through the ICCR Scholarship. I have a strong interest in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Deep Learning**, and **Computer Vision**. Currently, I am focused on **image processing**, **medical image analysis**, and **AI/ML-based applications**.

## 🔭 Current Work

- **MedImagePro**: A tkinter-based application for image operations, including DICOM file support, image filtering, PDF exporting, and detection tasks (YOLO-based filter integration).
- **AI/ML Research**: I am working on developing and analyzing AI/ML models, specifically in the context of depression detection using sentiment-guided transformers and severity-aware contrastive learning.

## 🌱 Learning and Research Interests

- **Deep Learning** for image processing and segmentation.
- **Multi-Task Learning (MTL)**, especially in bargaining games and multi-agent systems.
- **Cyber-Physical Systems** and **Generalizable Robot Learning**.
- **AI for Healthcare**: Exploring innovative solutions in medical diagnostics.

## 👯 Collaborations and Research

I am currently an intern at **IIT Mandi**, where I am involved in AI/ML model development and dataset analysis under the guidance of Dr. Dinesh Singh.

## 💻 Technologies and Tools

- **Languages**: Python, C++
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, Keras, Scikit-learn, Librosa
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks, Docker, VS Code, Tkinter
